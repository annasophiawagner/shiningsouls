              The project <b>SHINING SOULS</b> was created as part of the elective course Interactive Media Installations at Furtwangen University and focused on the theme:
              <br><br> <i>"feedback and control - expecationand relief“</i><br><br><br><br>
              From the initial brainstorming to the final implementation, our project underwent an exciting and dynamic development process. At first, we let our creativity run free, designing visionary concepts with far-reaching, almost utopian ideas. But with each iteration, our focus became clearer: we wanted to create an interactive installation that strengthens the sense of community and connects people on both an emotional and visual level. <br><br><br>
              <b>The Inspiration: A Reflection of Our Time</b><br><br>
                In a world shaped by individualization and self-optimization, awareness of one another often fades into the background. Our daily lives are often hectic, and our gaze is directed inward. But what happens when we pause, consciously perceive our surroundings, and engage with other people? SHINING SOULS addresses precisely this question and invites visitors to immerse themselves in a unique, immersive experience. <br><br><br>

                <b>The Experience: Light, Movement, and Connection</b><br><br>
                Upon entering the room, visitors encounter a mysterious atmosphere. In the center floats a pulsating particle circle, a central visual element that sparks curiosity and amazement. Two glowing circles accompany the visitors and respond gently to their movements. Using a Kinect camera, the positions of those present are detected and processed in TouchDesigner. Initially, the light circles exist in isolation, but as two people approach each other, they begin to interact. <br><br>
              With each approach, the light circles grow together and gradually merge. The intensity of the light increases as visitors form a closer connection – a powerful symbol of interpersonal bonds. What begins as an individual experience transforms into a shared, almost magical moment.
              <br><br><br><b>The Message: Consciously Experiencing Encounters</b><br><br>
              <b>SHINING SOULS</b> encourages visitors to become aware of their own presence in the space while also exploring the dynamics of proximity and distance. The installation reveals that encounters are not only physical in nature but always create emotional resonance. The interplay of <b>light, sound, movement,</b> and interaction builds a bridge between individuals, influencing each other simply through their presence. <br><br><br>
              <b>Presentation and Outlook</b><br><br>
              On January 22, 2025, SHINING SOULS was presented as part of the Faculty of Digital Media’s exhibition. The interaction with the audience provided us with valuable insights into the impact of our installation and reinforced our motivation to further develop our concept. The positive reactions and the visible amazement of the visitors confirmed that we had struck a chord with our idea.
              <br><br><br>Our vision for the future? To continue expanding SHINING SOULS, refining its interactivity, and finding new ways to sustainably strengthen the sense of community in both the digital and physical worlds.
